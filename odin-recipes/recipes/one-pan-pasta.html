    <h1>One Pan Pasta</h1>
    <img src="../img/one-pan-pasta.webp" alt="The best lasagna ever" width="350">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is our original one-pot pasta recipe, inspired by a dish one of our food editors ate in Puglia, Italy. It uses a revolutionary technique: All the ingredients cook together in the same pan (a straight-sided skillet). You don’t even need to boil water first.</p>
    <p>You can use cherry or grape tomatoes for this recipe. You’ll also need onion, garlic, fresh basil (this is not a time to use dried), plus extra-virgin olive oil. All go into the pan with the linguine.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces linguine</li>
        <li>12 ounces cherry or grape tomatoes, halved or quartered if large</li>
        <li>1 onion, thinly sliced (about 2 cups)</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red-pepper flakes</li>
        <li>2 sprigs basil, plus torn leaves for garnish</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>4 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine ingredients in pan and bring to a boil: Combine pasta, tomatoes, onion, garlic, red-pepper flakes, basil, oil, 2 teaspoons salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and water in a large straight-sided skillet. Bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring: Boil mixture, stirring and turning pasta frequently with tongs, until pasta is al dente and water has nearly evaporated, about 9 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season and serve: Season to taste with salt and pepper, divide among 4 bowls, and garnish with basil. Serve with oil and Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
